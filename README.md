# EV-Charging-User-Type-Prediction
This project aims to predict user types (e.g., Commuter, Casual Driver, Long-Distance Traveler) based on electric vehicle (EV) charging session data. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model helps identify user behavior patterns, which can assist in charging infrastructure optimization, and personalized energy recommendations.
